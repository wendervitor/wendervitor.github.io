# My page

This project describe somethings about me and my life such as projects that i've made, my resume, etc...
All pages have a bootstrap navbar component to navigation.

## index.html

On index, i just put my image, my name and a button linking to my projects. In the button, i've used the bootstrap button and a sass inheritance to re-use in the projects page.

## projects.html

This page has a list of some of my projects on github, with a description of the project and a list of tools used. I've used the bootstrap grid model to determine columns for 'lg', 'md' and 'sm' and make the visual pleasent in all kind of devices. Besides, i've used bootstrap cards too.

## academic.html

Here I created a page of 3 sections separated by a line. The first section put my academic curriculum; the second, in an unordered list, some of the programming skills I have; The third, in a table, my language skills. To make the page responsive, i've used the media query: some devices gonna be 3 columns and others 3 rows.

## contact.html

In this last page i just put some of my social media and a quotation that i like. Nothing special was made with stylization or bootstrap here.
